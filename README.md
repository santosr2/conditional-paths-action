> [!NOTE]
> This action builds upon [dorny/paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter), forked from [commit de90cc6](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter/commit/de90cc6fb38fc0963ad72b210f1f284cd68cea36). Special thanks to Dorny and all contributors for laying the groundwork for this enhanced version.

A powerful [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that enables conditional execution of workflow steps and jobs based on the files modified by pull requests, feature branches, or recent commits.

**‚ö° Why Use This Action?**

- **Save Time & Resources**: Run slow tasks like integration tests or deployments only for changed components
- **Perfect for Monorepos**: Ideal for multi-package repositories where you only want to build/test affected packages
- **Flexible Detection**: Works with pull requests, feature branches, and long-lived branches
- **Rich Output Formats**: Get file lists in JSON, CSV, shell, or escaped formats
- **Advanced Filtering**: Support for glob patterns, change types (added/modified/deleted), and predicate quantifiers

> [!Note]
> GitHub's built-in [path filters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) don't work at the job or step level, making this action essential for conditional workflow execution.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```yaml
- uses: santosr2/conditional-paths-action@v1
  id: changes
  with:
    filters: |
      src:
        - 'src/**'
      docs:
        - 'docs/**'
        - '*.md'

# Run only if source code changed
- name: Build and Test
  if: steps.changes.outputs.src == 'true'
  run: npm run build && npm test

# Run only if documentation changed
- name: Deploy Docs
  if: steps.changes.outputs.docs == 'true'
  run: npm run deploy:docs
```

## üîó Node.js Compatibility Matrix

This action supports **dual Node.js compatibility** to maximize compatibility across different environments:

### ‚úÖ Supported Versions

| Environment | Node.js Version | Status | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|--------|---------|
| **GitHub Actions Runtime** | **Node.js 24** | ‚úÖ Primary | Action execution in workflows |
| **Local Development** | **Node.js 22** | ‚úÖ Supported | Development and testing |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | **Node.js 22** | ‚úÖ Tested | Dependabot compatibility |

### üîÑ Matrix Validation

**All workflows (CI, security scans, documentation generation, performance benchmarks, and SBOM generation) are validated on a Node.js 22/24 compatibility matrix.** This ensures the action works reliably across both development and runtime environments.

Our CI pipeline runs comprehensive testing across:
- **Node.js 22**: Development, CI, and Dependabot compatibility
- **Node.js 24**: GitHub Actions runtime validation
- **Matrix Strategy**: `fail-fast: false` ensures both versions are fully tested

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    node-version: [22, 24]  # Full compatibility matrix
```

This approach provides maximum compatibility while leveraging the latest GitHub Actions runtime capabilities.

## üìã Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `filters` | Path to YAML file or inline YAML string defining path filters | ‚úÖ Yes | |
| `token` | GitHub token for API access (pull requests only) | ‚ùå No | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `base` | Git reference to compare against | ‚ùå No | Repository default branch |
| `ref` | Git reference to detect changes from | ‚ùå No | `${{ github.ref }}` |
| `working-directory` | Relative path where repository was checked out | ‚ùå No | |
| `list-files` | Output format for matched files: `none`, `csv`, `json`, `shell`, `escape` | ‚ùå No | `none` |
| `initial-fetch-depth` | Initial number of commits to fetch for comparison | ‚ùå No | `100` |
| `predicate-quantifier` | Pattern matching mode: `some` (OR) or `every` (AND) | ‚ùå No | `some` |

## üì§ Outputs

For each filter named `{filter-name}`, the action provides:

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `{filter-name}` | `string` | `'true'` if any files match the filter, `'false'` otherwise |
| `{filter-name}_count` | `number` | Count of files matching the filter |
| `{filter-name}_files` | `string` | List of matching files (when `list-files` is enabled) |
| `changes` | `string` | JSON array of all filter names with matches |

## üîê Required Permissions

This action requires specific permissions depending on the workflow trigger:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: read  # Required for pull_request events
  contents: read       # Required for repository access
```

**Note**: For `pull_request` workflows, only `pull-requests: read` is required as the action uses the GitHub API for faster performance.
