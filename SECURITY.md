# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

The Conditional Paths Action team takes security seriously. We appreciate the community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and work to address them promptly.

## üîç Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Node.js Compatibility | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| v1.x.x  | ‚úÖ Yes | Node.js 22 (dev) / 24 (runtime) | **Current** - Full support |
| v0.x.x  | ‚ùå No  | Node.js 16/18 | **Legacy** - No longer supported |

### Runtime Environment Security

Our action supports dual Node.js compatibility with enhanced security validation:

- **GitHub Actions Runtime**: Node.js 24 (`using: node24`)
- **Development Environment**: Node.js 22 (tested in CI matrix)
- **CI/CD Validation**: Both versions tested with comprehensive security scans

## üö® Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Where to Report

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, use one of these secure methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

Report security vulnerabilities through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/santosr2/conditional-paths-action/security/advisories/new):

1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with details
4. Submit for private disclosure

#### 2. Email Disclosure

Send security reports to: **security@[repository-domain]**

Include:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Initial acknowledgment of report |
| **72 hours** | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| **7 days** | Detailed investigation and impact analysis |
| **30 days** | Fix development, testing, and release preparation |
| **Coordinated** | Public disclosure after fix is available |

## üîí Security Measures

### Active Security Scanning

Our repository implements comprehensive security measures:

#### üõ°Ô∏è Automated Security Scanning

- **[CodeQL Analysis](https://github.com/santosr2/conditional-paths-action/security/code-scanning)**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Secret Scanning**: GitLeaks detection prevents credential leaks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner for known CVEs
- **License Compliance**: SPDX validation and approved license checking

#### üìã Supply Chain Security

- **SBOM Generation**: Complete Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX format
- **Dependency Pinning**: Exact version pinning for all dependencies
- **SHA Pinning**: All GitHub Actions pinned by commit SHA
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Automated dependency vulnerability tracking

#### üîê Development Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security validation on every commit
- **Dual Node.js Testing**: Security validation across Node.js 22/24 matrix
- **Minimal Permissions**: Least-privilege principle in action.yml
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs

### Security Configuration

#### Required Permissions

The action uses minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read       # Required for repository access
  pull-requests: read  # Required for PR workflows only
```

#### Secure Defaults

- **No Network Access**: Action doesn't make outbound network calls (except GitHub API)
- **Read-Only Operations**: File system access is read-only for source files
- **Token Scope**: Uses provided GitHub token with minimal necessary permissions
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

## üéØ Vulnerability Categories

We treat the following as security vulnerabilities:

### High Priority

- **Code Execution**: Arbitrary code execution through action inputs
- **Credential Exposure**: Leakage of tokens, secrets, or sensitive data
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access or elevated permissions
- **Path Traversal**: Access to files outside intended directories

### Medium Priority

- **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of non-sensitive internal information
- **DoS Vulnerabilities**: Resource exhaustion or infinite loops
- **Injection Attacks**: Command injection or script injection
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: High/Critical severity in dependencies

### Low Priority

- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default configurations
- **Minor Information Leaks**: Limited exposure of non-sensitive data
- **Denial of Service**: Service disruption with minimal impact

## üîß Security Best Practices for Users

### Workflow Security

When using this action in your workflows:

#### ‚úÖ Recommended

```yaml
- uses: santosr2/conditional-paths-action@v1.0.0  # Pin to specific version
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Use provided token
    filters: |  # Define filters in workflow (transparent)
      src: 'src/**'
      docs: 'docs/**'
```

#### ‚ùå Not Recommended

```yaml
- uses: santosr2/conditional-paths-action@main  # Don't use branch references
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}  # Avoid personal tokens if possible
    filters: '.github/secret-filters.yml'  # External files less transparent
```

### Input Validation

- **Filter Patterns**: Use specific, well-defined glob patterns
- **File Paths**: Avoid user-controlled file paths when possible
- **Token Usage**: Use the minimum token scope required for your workflow

### Monitoring

- **Action Usage**: Monitor action outputs in workflow logs
- **Repository Access**: Regularly review repository access and permissions
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep the action pinned to latest secure version
